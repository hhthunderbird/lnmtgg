# Color Converter FAQ

## What is a color format?

A color format is a way to represent colors using different numerical values. Common formats include HEX, RGB, and HSL, each with its own advantages and use cases.

## What color formats are supported?

The tool supports three main color formats:
- HEX (Hexadecimal)
- RGB (Red, Green, Blue)
- HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness)

## What is the difference between RGB and HSL?

- **RGB**: Represents colors using three values for red, green, and blue (0-255 each)
- **HSL**: Represents colors using hue (0-360°), saturation (0-100%), and lightness (0-100%)

## Why use different color formats?

Different formats are useful for different purposes:
- HEX: Best for web development and CSS
- RGB: Good for screen display and digital design
- HSL: Useful for color adjustments and creating color schemes

## What is a HEX color code?

A HEX color code is a 6-digit hexadecimal number prefixed with # that represents a color. Each pair of digits represents the red, green, and blue components.

## How do I convert between formats?

The tool automatically converts colors between all supported formats. Just enter a color in any format, and the tool will show the equivalent values in other formats.

## What is color space?

Color space is a specific organization of colors that allows for reproducible representations of color. Different color spaces (like RGB and HSL) represent colors in different ways.

## Can I use 3-digit HEX codes?

Yes, 3-digit HEX codes (like #F00) are supported and will be automatically expanded to 6 digits (like #FF0000).

## What is the alpha channel?

The alpha channel represents transparency in a color. While the tool focuses on solid colors, some formats (like RGBA and HSLA) support transparency.

## How accurate are the conversions?

The conversions are mathematically precise, but colors might appear slightly different on different devices due to screen calibration and color profiles.

## What are web-safe colors?

Web-safe colors are a set of 216 colors that display consistently across different platforms and browsers. While less important now, they're still useful for legacy systems.

## How do I choose the right color format?

Choose based on your needs:
- Use HEX for web development
- Use RGB for digital design
- Use HSL when you need to adjust colors easily

## What is the difference between RGB and CMYK?

RGB (Red, Green, Blue):
- Used for digital displays
- Additive color model
- Each component ranges from 0-255
- Combines to create white

CMYK (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Key/Black):
- Used for printing
- Subtractive color model
- Each component ranges from 0-100%
- Combines to create black

## What is HSL and why use it?

HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness):
- More intuitive for color adjustments
- Hue: Color position on the color wheel (0-360°)
- Saturation: Color intensity (0-100%)
- Lightness: Brightness (0-100%)
- Easier to create color variations

## How do I handle color accessibility?

For accessibility:
- Ensure sufficient contrast
- Don't rely on color alone
- Test with color blindness simulators
- Follow WCAG guidelines
- Use color contrast checkers

## What are color profiles?

Color profiles:
- Define how colors are interpreted
- Important for consistent display
- Common profiles: sRGB, Adobe RGB
- Critical for professional work
- Help maintain color accuracy

## How do I create color schemes?

Color scheme types:
- Monochromatic: One hue, different shades
- Complementary: Opposite colors
- Analogous: Adjacent colors
- Triadic: Three evenly spaced colors
- Split-complementary: Base + two opposites

## What are the best practices for color conversion?

1. Start with high-quality source colors
2. Consider the target medium
3. Test converted colors
4. Use appropriate color profiles
5. Verify accessibility
6. Document color values
7. Consider cultural meanings
