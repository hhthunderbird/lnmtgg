# URL Encoder FAQ

## General Questions

### What is URL encoding?
URL encoding is the process of converting special characters in a URL into a format that can be safely transmitted over the internet. It replaces unsafe characters with a percent sign (%) followed by two hexadecimal digits.

### Why do I need to encode URLs?
URLs can only contain a specific set of characters. Special characters, spaces, and non-ASCII characters need to be encoded to ensure they're transmitted correctly and safely across the web.

### What characters need to be encoded?
Characters that need encoding include:
- Spaces
- Special characters (!, #, $, &, etc.)
- Non-ASCII characters
- Reserved characters in URLs

## Technical Questions

### What is the difference between URL encoding and URL escaping?
URL encoding and URL escaping are essentially the same thing. Both terms refer to the process of converting special characters into a URL-safe format using percent encoding.

### How does URL encoding work?
URL encoding works by:
1. Converting special characters to their ASCII value
2. Converting the ASCII value to hexadecimal
3. Adding a percent sign (%) before the hexadecimal value

### What is percent encoding?
Percent encoding is the method used in URL encoding where special characters are replaced with a percent sign (%) followed by two hexadecimal digits representing the character's ASCII value.

## Usage Questions

### How do I encode a URL?
1. Enter your URL in the input field
2. Click the "Encode" button
3. The encoded URL will appear in the output field
4. Use the "Copy" button to copy the encoded URL

### How do I decode a URL?
1. Paste the encoded URL in the input field
2. Click the "Decode" button
3. The decoded URL will appear in the output field
4. Use the "Copy" button to copy the decoded URL

### Can I encode multiple URLs at once?
Yes, you can encode multiple URLs by:
1. Entering each URL on a new line
2. Clicking the "Encode" button
3. Each URL will be encoded separately
4. You can copy all encoded URLs at once

## Character Encoding

### What is the difference between UTF-8 and ASCII encoding?
- ASCII encoding uses 7 bits and can represent 128 characters
- UTF-8 is a variable-width encoding that can represent all Unicode characters
- URL encoding typically uses UTF-8 for international characters

### How are spaces encoded in URLs?
Spaces can be encoded in two ways:
1. As `%20` (most common)
2. As `+` (in query strings)

### How are special characters encoded?
Special characters are encoded as follows:
- `!` becomes `%21`
- `#` becomes `%23`
- `$` becomes `%24`
- `&` becomes `%26`
- And so on...

## Query String Questions

### How do I encode query parameters?
1. Enter your query string in the input field
2. Click the "Encode" button
3. The encoded query string will appear in the output field
4. Use the "Copy" button to copy the encoded string

### What is the difference between encoding a URL and encoding query parameters?
- URL encoding focuses on the entire URL path
- Query parameter encoding focuses on the values after the `?` in a URL
- Both use the same encoding method but may have different requirements

### How do I handle multiple query parameters?
Multiple query parameters should be:
1. Separated by `&`
2. Each parameter value encoded separately
3. Maintained in the correct order
4. Properly formatted with `key=value` pairs
