# Text Case Converter FAQ

## What is text case conversion?

Text case conversion is the process of changing the capitalization of text. It allows you to transform text between different formats like uppercase, lowercase, title case, and more.

## What case formats are available?

The tool supports the following case formats:
- UPPERCASE
- lowercase
- Title Case
- Sentence case
- camelCase
- PascalCase
- snake_case
- kebab-case

## When should I use each case format?

- **UPPERCASE**: For emphasis, headings, or when all text needs to be capitalized
- **lowercase**: For general text, sentences, or when all text should be in small letters
- **Title Case**: For titles, headings, or when each word should start with a capital letter
- **Sentence case**: For normal sentences where only the first word is capitalized
- **camelCase**: For variable names in programming (first word lowercase, subsequent words capitalized)
- **PascalCase**: For class names in programming (all words capitalized)
- **snake_case**: For file names, variable names, or when using underscores as separators
- **kebab-case**: For URLs, CSS classes, or when using hyphens as separators

## Does the tool preserve special characters?

Yes, the tool preserves all special characters, numbers, and symbols. Only the letters are affected by the case conversion.

## Can I convert multiple lines of text?

Yes, the tool can handle multiple lines of text. Each line will be converted according to the selected case format.

## What happens to numbers and special characters?

Numbers and special characters remain unchanged during the conversion process. Only letters are affected by the case conversion.

## Is there a limit to the text length?

The tool can handle large amounts of text, but very long texts might take longer to process.

## Can I use this for programming code?

Yes, the tool is particularly useful for converting between different programming naming conventions like camelCase, PascalCase, and snake_case.

## How do I handle acronyms?

The tool treats acronyms like regular words. If you need to preserve acronyms in their original case, you'll need to manually adjust the result.

## Is the conversion reversible?

Yes, you can convert text back and forth between different case formats. However, some information might be lost when converting to lowercase or uppercase.
