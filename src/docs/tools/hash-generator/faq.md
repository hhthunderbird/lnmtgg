# Hash Generator FAQ

## General Questions

### What is a hash function?
A hash function is a mathematical function that converts input data of any size into a fixed-size string of characters. The output is typically a hexadecimal string that represents the input data.

### Why use hash functions?
Hash functions are used for:
- Data integrity verification
- Password storage
- Digital signatures
- File identification
- Data deduplication

### Is hashing the same as encryption?
No, hashing is different from encryption:
- Hashing is one-way (cannot be reversed)
- Encryption is two-way (can be decrypted)
- Hashes are fixed length
- Encrypted data can be any length

## Technical Questions

### What hash algorithms are supported?
The tool supports:
- MD5 (128-bit)
- SHA-1 (160-bit)
- SHA-256 (256-bit)
- SHA-512 (512-bit)

### Which algorithm should I use?
- MD5: Quick file checks
- SHA-1: Legacy systems
- SHA-256: General security
- SHA-512: High security

### What is the maximum file size?
The tool can handle files up to 10MB. For larger files, consider using a desktop application.

### Can I hash multiple files at once?
Currently, the tool processes one file at a time. For multiple files, you'll need to hash them separately.

## Usage Questions

### How do I generate a hash?
1. Enter text or upload a file
2. Select the hash algorithm
3. Click "Generate"
4. Copy the result

### How do I verify a hash?
1. Enter the original text/file
2. Enter the hash to verify
3. Click "Verify"
4. Check the result

### Can I compare two hashes?
Yes, you can:
- Compare text hashes
- Compare file hashes
- Verify against known hashes
- Check for matches

### How do I save hash results?
- Use the "Copy" button
- Download as text file
- Save to clipboard
- Export results

## Security Questions

### Is MD5 secure?
No, MD5 is not secure for:
- Password storage
- Digital signatures
- Security applications
- Sensitive data

### What about SHA-1?
SHA-1 is also not recommended for:
- New security applications
- Password storage
- Digital signatures
- High-security needs

### Which algorithm is most secure?
SHA-512 is currently the most secure option, followed by SHA-256. However, security requirements vary by use case.

### Should I use salt with hashes?
Yes, always use salt for:
- Password hashing
- Security applications
- Sensitive data
- User authentication

## Performance Questions

### How fast is each algorithm?
- MD5: Fastest
- SHA-1: Fast
- SHA-256: Moderate
- SHA-512: Slowest

### Does file size affect performance?
Yes:
- Larger files take longer
- Memory usage increases
- Processing time varies
- Browser performance matters

### Can I hash large files?
- Up to 10MB is supported
- Larger files need desktop tools
- Consider chunking
- Monitor memory usage

### How do I optimize performance?
- Choose appropriate algorithm
- Consider file size
- Use efficient methods
- Monitor system resources

## Troubleshooting

### The tool is not generating hashes
- Check input format
- Verify file size
- Clear browser cache
- Try different algorithm

### Hashes don't match
- Check input data
- Verify algorithm
- Compare carefully
- Check for whitespace

### File hashing fails
- Check file size
- Verify file format
- Try different file
- Clear browser cache

### Performance issues
- Reduce file size
- Choose faster algorithm
- Close other applications
- Check system resources

## Browser Support

### Which browsers are supported?
The tool works in:
- Chrome (recommended)
- Firefox
- Safari
- Edge
- Opera

### Do I need to install anything?
No, the tool runs entirely in your browser. No installation or plugins required.

### Is there a mobile version?
Yes, the tool is fully responsive and works on mobile devices.

## Advanced Features

### Can I customize the output format?
Currently, the tool outputs standard hexadecimal format. Additional formats may be added in future updates.

### Is there an API available?
Not yet, but we're working on providing an API for programmatic access.

### Can I use the tool offline?
Yes, you can use the tool offline once the page is loaded. However, you'll need an internet connection to access the tool initially.
