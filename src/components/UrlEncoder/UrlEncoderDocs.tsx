      questions: [
        {
          question: 'What characters need to be URL encoded?',
          answer: 'Characters that need encoding include spaces, special characters (!@#$%^&*), and non-ASCII characters. Only alphanumeric characters (A-Z, a-z, 0-9) and a few special characters (-_.~) can be used without encoding.'
        },
        {
          question: 'What is the difference between URL encoding and HTML encoding?',
          answer: 'URL encoding uses percent-encoding (%xx) for special characters, while HTML encoding uses character entities (&xx;). They serve different purposes and should not be used interchangeably.'
        },
        {
          question: 'Should I encode the entire URL?',
          answer: 'No, you should only encode the parts of the URL that contain special characters. The protocol (http://), domain name, and path separators (/) should not be encoded.'
        },
        {
          question: 'How do I handle international characters in URLs?',
          answer: 'International characters should be encoded using UTF-8 and then percent-encoded. For example, "Ã©" becomes "%C3%A9" in a URL.'
