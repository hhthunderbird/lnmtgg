# Number Base Converter FAQ

## What is a number base?

A number base (or radix) is the number of unique digits used to represent numbers in a positional numeral system. For example, decimal uses base 10 (digits 0-9), while binary uses base 2 (digits 0-1).

## What number bases are supported?

The tool supports four common number bases:
- Binary (Base 2)
- Octal (Base 8)
- Decimal (Base 10)
- Hexadecimal (Base 16)

## Why are different number bases used?

Different bases are used for different purposes:
- Binary: Fundamental to computer systems
- Octal: Used in some programming and file permissions
- Decimal: Standard for human use
- Hexadecimal: Common in programming and memory addresses

## What is the difference between binary and hexadecimal?

- Binary uses only 0 and 1 (base 2)
- Hexadecimal uses 0-9 and A-F (base 16)
- One hexadecimal digit represents four binary digits
- Hexadecimal is more compact than binary

## How do I convert between bases?

The tool automatically converts numbers between bases. Just enter a number, select the source and target bases, and click "Convert Number".

## What is a bit?

A bit (binary digit) is the smallest unit of data in computing, represented by either 0 or 1. Eight bits make up one byte.

## What is a byte?

A byte is a unit of digital information that consists of 8 bits. It can represent 256 different values (2^8).

## Can I convert negative numbers?

Yes, the tool supports negative numbers in all bases. The negative sign is preserved during conversion.

## What is two's complement?

Two's complement is a method of representing negative numbers in binary. The tool handles this automatically for binary conversions.

## How do I handle large numbers?

The tool can handle large numbers, but very large numbers might be displayed in scientific notation in some bases.

## What is the relationship between bases?

- 1 hexadecimal digit = 4 binary digits
- 1 octal digit = 3 binary digits
- 1 decimal digit = approximately 3.32 binary digits

## Why is hexadecimal used in programming?

Hexadecimal is used because:
- It's more compact than binary
- It's easy to convert to/from binary
- It's human-readable
- It's commonly used for memory addresses and color codes

## What are the advantages of each base?

Binary (Base-2):
- Direct representation of computer data
- Simple to implement in hardware
- Basic building block of digital systems

Octal (Base-8):
- Compact representation of binary
- Easy to convert to/from binary
- Used in Unix permissions

Decimal (Base-10):
- Natural for human understanding
- Standard for general calculations
- Most familiar number system

Hexadecimal (Base-16):
- Compact representation of binary
- Easy to convert to/from binary
- Common in programming

## How do I handle negative numbers?

Negative numbers:
- Can be represented in different ways
- Two's complement is common in binary
- Sign bit indicates negative
- Consider number size limitations

## What is overflow?

Overflow occurs when:
- A number is too large for its representation
- Results in incorrect values
- Common in fixed-size systems
- Important to check for in conversions

## How do I handle floating-point numbers?

Floating-point:
- More complex than integer conversion
- Requires special handling
- Different formats (IEEE 754)
- Consider precision issues

## What are the common uses in programming?

Common uses:
- Memory addresses (hex)
- Bit flags (binary)
- File permissions (octal)
- General calculations (decimal)
- Color codes (hex)
- Network protocols

## What are the best practices for number conversion?

1. Validate input numbers
2. Check for overflow
3. Consider number size
4. Use appropriate data types
5. Handle negative numbers
6. Consider precision
7. Test edge cases
