# Base64 Converter FAQ

## General Questions

### What is Base64 encoding?
Base64 is a binary-to-text encoding scheme that represents binary data in an ASCII string format. It's commonly used to encode binary data for transmission over text-based protocols.

### Why use Base64 encoding?
Base64 encoding is useful when you need to:
- Transfer binary data over text-based protocols
- Embed binary files in text documents
- Store binary data in text format
- Handle file uploads in web applications

### Is Base64 encoding secure?
No, Base64 is not encryption. It's a encoding scheme that can be easily decoded. For sensitive data, always use proper encryption in addition to Base64 encoding.

## Technical Questions

### What is the maximum file size I can encode?
The tool can handle files up to 10MB in size. For larger files, we recommend using a desktop application or chunking the file into smaller parts.

### Does the tool support all file types?
Yes, the tool can encode any file type since Base64 works with binary data. However, some file types may require special handling when decoding.

### What's the difference between standard and URL-safe Base64?
- Standard Base64 uses `+` and `/` characters
- URL-safe Base64 uses `-` and `_` instead
- URL-safe encoding is better for use in URLs and filenames

### How do I handle large files?
- Break down large files into smaller chunks
- Use streaming for very large files
- Consider using a desktop application for files over 10MB

## Usage Questions

### How do I encode text?
1. Enter your text in the input area
2. Click the "Encode" button
3. Copy the encoded result

### How do I decode Base64?
1. Paste the Base64 string in the input area
2. Click the "Decode" button
3. View or copy the decoded result

### Can I encode multiple files at once?
Currently, the tool processes one file at a time. For multiple files, you'll need to encode them separately.

### How do I save encoded/decoded files?
Use the "Download" button to save the result as a file. The tool will automatically use the appropriate file extension.

## Troubleshooting

### The tool is not encoding my file
- Check if the file is not corrupted
- Ensure the file size is within limits
- Try a different file format
- Clear your browser cache

### I'm getting an error when decoding
- Verify the input is valid Base64
- Check for missing padding characters
- Ensure the input is complete
- Try removing any whitespace

### The decoded file is corrupted
- Check if the Base64 string is complete
- Verify the encoding process
- Ensure no characters were modified
- Try re-encoding the original file

## Browser Support

### Which browsers are supported?
The tool works in all modern browsers:
- Chrome (recommended)
- Firefox
- Safari
- Edge
- Opera

### Do I need to install anything?
No, the tool runs entirely in your browser. No installation or plugins required.

### Is there a mobile version?
Yes, the tool is fully responsive and works on mobile devices.

## Advanced Features

### Can I customize the encoding?
Currently, the tool uses standard Base64 encoding. URL-safe encoding is available as an option.

### Is there an API available?
Not yet, but we're working on providing an API for programmatic access.

### Can I use the tool offline?
Yes, you can use the tool offline once the page is loaded. However, you'll need an internet connection to access the tool initially.

## Performance

### How fast is the encoding/decoding?
- Text encoding/decoding is nearly instant
- File processing depends on file size
- Large files may take a few seconds
- Performance varies by browser and device

### Does the tool handle large files efficiently?
- Uses efficient algorithms
- Processes files in chunks
- Minimizes memory usage
- Provides progress feedback

## Security and Privacy

### Is my data safe?
- All processing is done in your browser
- No data is sent to our servers
- No data is stored or logged
- SSL encryption for secure data handling

### Can I use it for sensitive data?
- Base64 is not encryption
- Don't use for sensitive data alone
- Consider additional encryption
- Follow security best practices
