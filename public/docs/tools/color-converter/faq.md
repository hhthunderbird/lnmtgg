- Each component ranges from 0-100%
- Combines to create black

## What is HSL and why use it?

HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness):
- More intuitive for color adjustments
- Hue: Color position on the color wheel (0-360°)
- Saturation: Color intensity (0-100%)
- Lightness: Brightness (0-100%)
- Easier to create color variations

## What is the alpha channel?

The alpha channel:

- Range: 0 (transparent) to 1 (opaque)
- Available in RGBA and HSLA
- Represented as last two digits in HEX (AA)
- Useful for overlays and blending

## How do I convert between color spaces?

The tool automatically converts between:
- HEX ↔ RGB
- RGB ↔ HSL
- RGB ↔ CMYK
- All formats with alpha channel

## What are web-safe colors?

Web-safe colors:
- 216 colors that display consistently
- Based on 6 levels of each RGB component
- Less important with modern displays
- Still useful for legacy systems

## What is color gamut?

Color gamut:
- Range of colors a system can display
- RGB has a wider gamut than CMYK
- Some colors can't be perfectly converted
- Important for print-to-screen conversion

## How do I handle color accessibility?

For accessibility:
- Ensure sufficient contrast
- Don't rely on color alone
- Test with color blindness simulators
- Follow WCAG guidelines
- Use color contrast checkers

## What are color profiles?

Color profiles:
- Define how colors are interpreted
- Important for consistent display
- Common profiles: sRGB, Adobe RGB
- Critical for professional work
- Help maintain color accuracy

## How do I create color schemes?

- Monochromatic: One hue, different shades
- Complementary: Opposite colors
- Analogous: Adjacent colors
- Triadic: Three evenly spaced colors
- Split-complementary: Base + two opposites
