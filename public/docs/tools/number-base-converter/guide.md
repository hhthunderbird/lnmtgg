# Number Base Converter Guide

## What is a Number Base Converter?

A number base converter is a tool that helps you convert numbers between different number systems (bases). It's useful for programming, computer science, and understanding how computers represent numbers.

## How to Use the Number Base Converter

1. Enter your number in any of the supported bases:
   - Binary (base-2): 0-1
   - Octal (base-8): 0-7
   - Decimal (base-10): 0-9
   - Hexadecimal (base-16): 0-9, A-F
2. The tool will automatically convert the number to all other bases
3. Use "Copy" to copy any format to your clipboard
4. Use "Clear" to reset the input field

## Number Base Details

### Binary (Base-2)
- Uses only 0 and 1
- Example: 1010 (decimal 10)
- Common in computer systems
- Each digit is called a bit

### Octal (Base-8)
- Uses digits 0-7
- Example: 12 (decimal 10)
- Less common in modern computing
- Each digit represents 3 bits

### Decimal (Base-10)
- Uses digits 0-9
- Example: 10
- Standard number system
- Most familiar to humans

### Hexadecimal (Base-16)
- Uses digits 0-9 and letters A-F
- Example: A (decimal 10)
- Common in programming
- Each digit represents 4 bits

## Common Use Cases

- Programming and debugging
- Computer architecture
- Digital electronics
- Network protocols
- Memory addressing
- Color codes

## Tips

- Use binary for bit-level operations
- Use octal for Unix file permissions
- Use decimal for general calculations
- Use hexadecimal for memory addresses
- Consider number size limitations
- Watch for overflow errors
