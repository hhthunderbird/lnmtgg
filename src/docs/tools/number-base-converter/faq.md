# Number Base Converter FAQ

## General Questions

### What is number base conversion?
Number base conversion is the process of converting numbers between different number systems (bases), such as binary, decimal, hexadecimal, and octal.

### Why do I need to convert number bases?
Number base conversion is useful for:
- Programming and computer science
- Digital electronics
- Data representation
- System architecture
- Web development

### What number bases are supported?
The tool supports:
- Binary (base-2)
- Octal (base-8)
- Decimal (base-10)
- Hexadecimal (base-16)

## Technical Questions

### How does base conversion work?
Base conversion works by:
1. Converting the input number to decimal
2. Converting the decimal number to the target base
3. Handling special cases and formatting
4. Validating the result

### What is the difference between binary and hexadecimal?
- Binary uses only 0 and 1 (base-2)
- Hexadecimal uses 0-9 and A-F (base-16)
- Hexadecimal is more compact
- Each hex digit represents 4 binary digits

### What is the difference between decimal and octal?
- Decimal uses 0-9 (base-10)
- Octal uses 0-7 (base-8)
- Octal is more compact than decimal
- Each octal digit represents 3 binary digits

## Usage Questions
