# Number Base Converter FAQ

## What is a number base?

A number base (or radix) is:
- The number of unique digits used in a number system
- The position value multiplier
- Determines how numbers are represented
- Common bases: 2, 8, 10, 16

## How do I convert between bases?

The tool automatically converts between:
- Binary ↔ Decimal
- Octal ↔ Decimal
- Hexadecimal ↔ Decimal
- All bases with each other

## What is two's complement?

Two's complement:
- Method for representing negative numbers in binary
- Most significant bit indicates sign
- Used in computer systems
- Makes addition and subtraction simpler

## What are the advantages of each base?

Binary (Base-2):
- Direct representation of computer data
- Simple to implement in hardware
- Basic building block of digital systems

Octal (Base-8):
- Compact representation of binary
- Easy to convert to/from binary
- Used in Unix permissions

Decimal (Base-10):
- Natural for human understanding
- Standard for general calculations
- Most familiar number system

Hexadecimal (Base-16):
- Compact representation of binary
- Easy to convert to/from binary
- Common in programming

## How do I handle negative numbers?

Negative numbers:
- Can be represented in different ways
- Two's complement is common in binary
- Sign bit indicates negative
- Consider number size limitations

## What is overflow?

Overflow occurs when:
- A number is too large for its representation
- Results in incorrect values
- Common in fixed-size systems
- Important to check for in conversions

## How do I handle floating-point numbers?

Floating-point:
- More complex than integer conversion
- Requires special handling
- Different formats (IEEE 754)
- Consider precision issues

## What are the common uses in programming?

Common uses:
- Memory addresses (hex)
- Bit flags (binary)
- File permissions (octal)
- General calculations (decimal)
- Color codes (hex)
- Network protocols

## How do I handle large numbers?

For large numbers:
- Consider using BigInt
- Watch for precision loss
- Use appropriate data types
- Consider number size limitations

## What are the best practices for number conversion?

1. Validate input numbers
2. Check for overflow
3. Consider number size
4. Use appropriate data types
5. Handle negative numbers
6. Consider precision
7. Test edge cases
