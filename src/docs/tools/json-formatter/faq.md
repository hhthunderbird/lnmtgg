### Why should I format my JSON?
Formatted JSON is easier to read and debug. It helps identify syntax errors and makes the structure of your data more clear.

### What happens if my JSON is invalid?
The tool will display an error message indicating the line number and nature of the error. You can then fix the error and try again.
