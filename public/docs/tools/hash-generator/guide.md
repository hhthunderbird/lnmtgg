# Hash Generator Guide

## What is a Hash Generator?

A hash generator is a tool that converts input data into a fixed-size string of characters using cryptographic hash functions. These functions are one-way operations that produce a unique output for each unique input.

## How to Use the Hash Generator

1. Enter your text in the input field
2. Choose the desired hash algorithm:
   - MD5: 128-bit hash (32 characters)
   - SHA-1: 160-bit hash (40 characters)
   - SHA-256: 256-bit hash (64 characters)
   - SHA-512: 512-bit hash (128 characters)
3. Click "Generate" to create the hash
4. Use "Copy" to copy the result to your clipboard
5. Use "Clear" to reset the input field

## Common Use Cases

- Password hashing
- File integrity verification
- Digital signatures
- Data deduplication
- Checksums
- Blockchain technology

## Examples

Input | MD5 | SHA-1 | SHA-256 | SHA-512
------|-----|-------|---------|--------
hello | 5d41402abc4b2a76b9719d911017c592 | aaf4c61ddcc5e8a2dabede0f3b482cd9aea9434d | 2cf24dba5fb0a30e26e83b2ac5b9e29e1b161e5c1fa7425e73043362938b9824 | 9b71d224bd62f3785d96d46ad3ea3d73319bfbc2890caadae2dff72519673ca72323c3d99ba5c11d7c7acc6e14b8c5da0c4663475c2e5c3adef46f73bcdec043

## Security Considerations

- MD5 and SHA-1 are considered cryptographically broken and should not be used for security-sensitive applications
- SHA-256 and SHA-512 are currently considered secure for most applications
- Always use a salt when hashing passwords
- Consider using specialized password hashing algorithms like bcrypt or Argon2 for password storage

## Tips

- Use SHA-256 or SHA-512 for security-sensitive applications
- Use MD5 only for non-security purposes like file deduplication
- Always verify hashes using the same algorithm
- Keep your input data secure
- Consider using a salt for additional security
