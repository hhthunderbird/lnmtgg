# URL Encoder FAQ

## What is URL encoding?

URL encoding is a method to convert special characters and non-ASCII characters into a format that can be transmitted over the Internet. It replaces unsafe ASCII characters with a "%" followed by two hexadecimal digits.

## Why do I need to encode URLs?

URLs can only contain a limited set of ASCII characters. Any other characters need to be encoded to ensure proper transmission and interpretation by web servers and browsers.

## What characters need to be encoded?

The following characters need to be encoded:
- Spaces (encoded as %20)
- Special characters like !, #, $, &, ', (, ), *, +, ,, /, :, ;, =, ?, @, [, ]
- Non-ASCII characters (Unicode)
- Control characters

## What's the difference between encode and decode?

- Encode: Converts regular text into URL-encoded format
- Decode: Converts URL-encoded text back to its original form

## Is URL encoding secure?

URL encoding is not a security measure. It's a way to ensure proper transmission of data. For security, you should use HTTPS and proper authentication methods.

## Can I encode an entire URL?

Yes, but it's generally better to encode only the parts that need encoding (like query parameters) rather than the entire URL.

## What happens if I encode an already encoded URL?

This is called double encoding and can cause issues. The tool will still work, but the resulting URL might not function as expected.

## How do I handle international characters?

The tool automatically handles international characters by converting them to their UTF-8 encoded form.

## Can I use this for form data?

Yes, this tool can be used to encode form data, but remember that different parts of a form might need different encoding methods.

## Is there a limit to the text length?

The tool can handle large amounts of text, but very long URLs might not be supported by some browsers or servers.
