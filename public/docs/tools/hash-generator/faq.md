# Hash Generator FAQ

## What is a hash function?

A hash function is a mathematical function that converts input data of any size into a fixed-size string of characters. The output is called a hash value or hash code.

## What hash algorithms are available?

The tool supports three secure hash algorithms:
- SHA-256 (256-bit output)
- SHA-384 (384-bit output)
- SHA-512 (512-bit output)

## Why are there different hash algorithms?

Different hash algorithms offer different levels of security and output sizes. SHA-512 provides the highest security but produces longer hashes, while SHA-256 is more commonly used for general purposes.

## Is it possible to reverse a hash?

No, hash functions are one-way functions. It's computationally infeasible to reverse a hash to get the original input. This is why they're used for password storage and data integrity verification.

## What is a collision?

A collision occurs when two different inputs produce the same hash output. Good hash functions make collisions extremely unlikely, but they're theoretically possible due to the fixed output size.

## How secure are these hash algorithms?

- SHA-256: Considered secure for most applications
- SHA-384: More secure than SHA-256, with a larger output size
- SHA-512: Provides the highest security among the available options

## Can I use this for password hashing?

While these algorithms can be used for password hashing, it's recommended to use specialized password hashing algorithms like bcrypt or Argon2, which include built-in salt and are designed to be slow to prevent brute-force attacks.

## What is a salt?

A salt is random data that is added to the input before hashing. It helps prevent rainbow table attacks and makes the same password hash to different values.

## How do I verify a hash?

To verify a hash, you need to:
1. Hash the input data using the same algorithm
2. Compare the generated hash with the stored hash
3. If they match, the input data is verified

## Is there a limit to the input size?

The tool can handle large amounts of text, but very large inputs might take longer to process. The hash output size remains constant regardless of input size.

## Can I hash files?

This tool is designed for text input. For file hashing, you would need a different tool that can handle binary data.

## What are common use cases for hashing?

- Password storage
- File integrity verification
- Digital signatures
- Blockchain technology
- Data deduplication
- Checksums
